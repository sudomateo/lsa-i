# Overview

I created Linux System Administration I for technologists that have never heard of, or used, Linux. This course focuses on Linux skills needed to jumpstart a career in Linux systems administration. People that are looking to move away from an existing operating system, heighten their skills, or just simply learn a new technology should feel welcome in this course. Enjoy!
