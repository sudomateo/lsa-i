# Linux Origins

## What is Linux?

Before we can discuss what Linux is, we must discuss what operating systems are. At a high level, an operating system is the combination of two main components working together to perform a desired action. These two components of an operating system are the **kernel** and the **shell**. The kernel is a low-level program that interfaces with the hardware of a system. The shell is a user interface that provides an ability for a user to interact with the kernel.

Linux is a **kernel**!

During the 1980s, a man named Richard Stallman began work on an operating system that was similar to Unix but completely free and open-source. This became known as GNU, a recursive acronym meaning GNU's Not Unix. GNU is an operating system and set of free software that was created to provide an open-source alternative to Unix tools. 

During the 1990s, a man named Linus Torvalds was developing a kernel named Linux. Given that GNU tools were already developed and open-source, many developers worked to port over GNU tools to work on the Linux kernel. GNU had what Linux did not, and Linux had what GNU did not. Together, GNU and Linux became known as GNU/Linux. Today, it is common to hear people use the term Linux to refer to both the GNU tools and the Linux kernel together.
