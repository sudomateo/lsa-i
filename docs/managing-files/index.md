# Overview

This section covers how to manage files within Linux. We'll start by looking at the commands you will use to manage files. Then we'll cover some of the information that is provided by files. Finally, we'll discuss file permissions and learn how to view and change them.

It's recommended to run `vagrant destroy` and then `vagrant up` to destroy and recreate your virtual machine so you'll have a clean system.
